# Overview

I have always felt that even my favorite sudoku apps fall just short of what I hoped they could be, so I decided to see if I could make a product that could compete with them. This is my first attempt to develop using Anroid Studio, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose, so it was quite the wild ride to understand and interpret all of the documentaiton. But it was very satisfying!

This app is currently able to be opened, navigate between pages, and open your device's storage to access images.

# Development Environment

Anroid Studio, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose were used in the development of this app.

The AndroidX libraries of material3, appcompat, and navigation were essential additions to the core libraries.

# Future Work

- Integrate the ability to take photos (as an alternative to selecting existing photos)
- Connect a codebase that can interpret the image and return a sudoku puzzle
- Implement my own sudoku solving program as a hint giving tool to be used by players
